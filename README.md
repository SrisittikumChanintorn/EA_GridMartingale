# MQL4 Grid Trading EA ( with Martingale & Custom Sequence Money Management ) 

## Overview

This Expert Advisor (EA) implements a **basic grid trading strategy** without using any technical indicator for entry signals. It opens both Buy and Sell trades directly based on user configuration and adds grid orders as price moves against the position. It supports **custom martingale scaling**, **configurable grid distance**, and **profit-target-based group closing**.

## Key Features

- üîÅ **Grid logic**: adds positions when price moves against active trades
- üìà **Martingale scaling**: lot size increases per repeat cycle
- üéØ **Profit-based close**: closes all trades in one direction once net profit exceeds a defined threshold
- ‚öñÔ∏è Supports **dual direction** trading (Buy and Sell separately or together)

## How It Works

1. **Order Entry**:
   - If `open_buy` or `open_sell` is enabled and no trades exist in that direction, the EA opens a position immediately.
   - If trades already exist and price moves by at least `grid_*` points from last max/min price, a new order is opened with a calculated lot size based on `repeat_*` and `mul_*`.

2. **Order Exit**:
   - Once total floating profit (including swap and commission) in one direction exceeds `close_profit_*`, all trades in that direction are closed at once.
